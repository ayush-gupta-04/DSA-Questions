## Questions
##### fixed-length
* We have 2 options :
    * We can run a fixed length window , but only when the TC to check the validity of the window is not very large.
    * We can use var length window and when it's size is favourable , we will add it. We know to check validity of var size window is much less bacause the invalidity is caused only by the rth element.
##### var-length
* We Have 2 types here : 
    * On increasing the window size the window becomes invalid and we need to shrink it.
    * On increasing the window size the window becomes more valid but we need the min window , hence we shrink it while it's valid and calc the min.
